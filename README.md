# Pong Mobile Prototype

A simple 2D mobile Pong prototype made with Unity.  
The game uses Unity’s built-in physics system for realistic ball movement and allows the ball to spin depending on the paddle’s hit direction. Designed for mobile devices with touch controls.

##  Features

- Real-time 2D physics and collision system  
- Ball spin (angular velocity) based on paddle movement  
- Touch input controls for mobile gameplay  
- Basic score UI and restart system  

##  Purpose

This project was created as a learning and experimentation prototype to explore:
- Unity’s 2D physics interactions  
- Touch input handling for mobile devices
- Gameplay balancing and spin mechanics  

It is not a finished game — it’s a proof of concept that demonstrates physics-based gameplay design for mobile.
